                The main protagonist of this book, Bernard is a shy and somewhat vain character. He has been conditioned to believe in the society that is our future. He is a non-conformist who questions many things in the society he lives in, and as such, he tends to get into trouble. He sees society as evil because he is never allowed to experience the full emotional spectrum, and because he is mocked for his height.

                John is the first person in the novel who actually sees civilization as evil. He is raised outside of it, so he is able to see all of the differences better than anyone else. He often debates with Helmholtz, and he dislikes Mond. John thinks society is evil because nothing costs enough. He thinks that hard work should lead to benefits, not just benefits over and over again.

                Helmholtz is Bernard's friend. While Bernard might feel insecure due to his height, Helmholtz is the complete opposite. He is taller than average, stronger than average, and the ideal male in the society that they live in. He also dislikes the society that he lives in, and frequently discusses that topic with Bernard.

                Lenina is one of the few people that we see go from very connected to this society to completely changing over the course of the book. She starts out feeling a bit out of place in society, and she ends up rejecting it eventually. She learns to love other people as people, and not as temporary objects. She learns to see her society as evil, as it will not let her be with John.

                Mustapha Mond is a special case. For one, he helps keep society the way it is. The way that the main characters dislike it. However, he too disapproves of the way his world is. For one, he like to read banned old books, such as shakespeare. Another banned thing that he does is read poetry. However, he sees the need to keep these things hidden from society in order to keep society happy. He sees his job as keeping everyone else happy, at the cost of making him stressed due to the non conformists. He too saw the evil in society, and ended up promoting it for his own freedom.
